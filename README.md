#  Temperature & Humidity Sensor with Adafruit IO

**By Isak ThÃ¶rnqvist (it222hp)**

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an IoT temperature and humidity sensor using a DHT11 sensor and a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The device reads environmental data and transmits it to Adafruit IO using the MQTT protocol.

- **Estimated Time**: 8h
- **Skill Level**: Beginner

---

## Objective

I chose to build this sensor because indoor climate monitoring is valuable for comfort. With real-time temperature and humidity data accessible from anywhere, I can gain new insights into my environment and monitor how the temprature and humidity changes.

- **Why this project?** Simple but practical use of IoT for real-world sensing  
- **Purpose**: Collect and send environmental data to the Adafruit
- **Insights expected**: Understand more about IoT and the DHT11 sensor

# Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico W and MicroPython

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

-  All required materials listed above (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico W, Micro USB cable, etc.)

---

## Installing MicroPython Firmware

1. **Download the MicroPython firmware**  
   - Head over to the official Raspberry Pi Pico MicroPython page and grab the latest UF2 firmware for the Pico W.

2. **Connect the Pico W to your computer**  
   - Hold down the **BOOTSEL** button on the Pico W.  
   - While holding it, connect the board to your computer using a USB cable.  
   - Release the BOOTSEL button after connecting.

3. **Add MicroPython to Your Pico W**  
   - Your Pico W should appear as a **storage device** on your computer.  
   - Drag and drop or copy the downloaded **UF2 file** onto this device.  
   - The Pico W will automatically restart itself and should now be shown as a USB serial device.

---

## Installing VSCode and Pymakr Plugin

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**  
   - Download and install it from the [official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install the Pymakr Plugin**  
   - Open VSCode and go to the **Extensions** view (click the Extensions icon in the sidebar on the left side of the VSCode ui).  
   - Search for **Pymakr** by **Pycom** and click **Install**.

3. **Configure Pymakr Plugin**  
   - Click the **Pymakr icon** in the VSCode status bar.  
   - With your Pico W connected, you should see a list of devices.  
   - Hover over your device and click **Connect Device**.  

---

## Software Setup

1. **Install Node.js**  
   - Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
     
---

## Get Your Code onto the Pico W

1. **Create your MicroPython project**  
   - In VSCode you now need to create a new folder for your project.  
   - Inside the folder, create a Python file called main.py and add your MicroPython code there.

2. **Connect the computer to the Pico W**  
   - Make sure your Pico W is connected via USB.  
   - Click the **Pymakr icon** in the left sidebar and select the connect button **Connect**.

3. **Upload the code**  
   - Once connected, click **Sync Project to Device** from the Pymakr sidebar.  
   - Your code will be uploaded and executed on the Pico W.  
   - Optionally, enable **Development Mode** to auto-upload and restart the device on file changes.
